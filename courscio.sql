The historical, social, economic, and musical factors of various black American music genres will be examined with the aim to understand how African Americans constructed identity and interpreted the world around them. We will also discuss the performative aspects of these genres in order to understand how black music artists used their bodies and asserted their agency through performance on stage.

The class will look at photography as a cultural phenomenon as much as an art form, critically studying the various discursive arenas that this new medium helped to foster and redefine. We will also ask what makes photographic images so compelling, what we expect to see in them & what, distinguishes in the photographic realm a document from an artwork, & an ephemeral image from a material object.', 'No prerequisite specified'),

Engaging philosophy, art history, and photography theory, this course examines how photography has been used to give shape to various philosophies of the self, from the theory of autonomy put forward by philosophers of the Enlightenment to that of identity mediated by social discourse as proposed by contemporary critical theorists.

To pursue these questions, you will need to understand how language works as a formal system, a historical process, and a source of cultural identity. We’ll read authors such as George Lakoff, John McWhorter, and Gloria Anzaldua. You will write a few short papers and an 8-10 page argumentative research paper.
